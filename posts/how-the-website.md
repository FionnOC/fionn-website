Over the past summer, I completed an internship at Mawla Agency, where I was exposed to TypeScript and Next.js for the first time. I spent my weeks there learning JavaScript and TypeScript, and was able to implement my learning by altering the footer on the Mawla website. This was an extremely rewarding experience, and I wanted to continue this learning as my internship ended shortly after this was implemented.

I wanted to fully understand Next.js and how it works as a framework, so decided to create my own website, which would allow me to test my skills learned, while also learning more aspects of TypeScript.

I wanted to create a website that could act as my online CV, so that anyone could look at and view what development skills I have assembled in my time as an intern.

I decided to follow the Next.js tutorial found on the Next website. This tutorial was given in JavaScript, so I spent more time typing the code in TypeScript, learning the differences between the two languages. I hard typed variable types as this was what I was used to after coding in C for so long.

The next steps for this page will be:

- Creating a new website design in Figma
- Practice coding modules

I really want to practice my design skills, so by creating new designs in Figma will allow me to try and be creative and think of fun ideas to implement in this mini project. I would love to be able to design:

- A hero module for the home page
- Floating in text when you scroll down the page
- Some colour!
- Maybe a fun nav bar that slides away when not in use

I'll keep this blog updated as I continue! Please reach out if you have any suggestions. My email is fionn010@gmail.com :)
