Hello again!

It has been a while, but as I am currently off on my Christmas break, I thought it would be a good time to make some updates to the website!

I just added a section on some of my college projects, which quickly describes some of the work I have completed over the past few years. These projects are available on my github as well.

For the New Year, I have decided to take up some new resolutions!

- Read at least 8 books this year
- Watch at least 2 movies a month
- Make a quick blog post reviewing each month that passes to continuously update the website

Hopefully I will stick to them ...

I'll see you all next month!

Fionn
