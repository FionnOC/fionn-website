As I am heading into my final year of college, I have to complete a masters thesis in the field of Computer Engineering. After my experience in KU Leuven, I furthered my interest in Computer and Human interactions, completing modules such as Speech Recognition and Biometrics. I wanted to further this and chose a thesis topic in this area.

The project I have chosen is informally called "What's so Funny", which aims to investigate a difficult part of language, humour. It aims to understand how our brains process jokes by recording brain signals with electroencephalography from participants as they listen to speech.

As of now, I have successfully prepared my experiment and am waiting to start my first trials!
