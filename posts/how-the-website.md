Over the past summer, I completed an internship at Mawla Agency, where I was exposed to TypeScript and Next.js for the first time. I spent my weeks there learning JavaScript and TypeScript, and was able to implement my learning by altering the footer on the Mawla website. This was an extremely rewarding experience, and I wanted to continue this learning as my internship ended shortly after this was implemented.

I wanted to fully understand Next.js and how it works as a framework, so decided to create my own website. This would allow me to test my skills learned, while also learning more aspects of TypeScript.

I wanted to create a website that could act as my online CV, so that anyone could look at and view what development skills I have assembled.
